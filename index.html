          A dynamic AI landscape is emerging throughout Africa, poised to have a
          transformative impact. In Africa alone, over 2,400 companies are
          reportedly involved in AI. <br />
          According to Statista, the generative AI market in Africa is expected
          to expand from $0.89 billion in 2024 to $8.75 billion by 2028. More
          than 30 AI communities, from developing regions such as Sudan and Mali
          to well-established centers like South Africa and Tunisia, are leading
          this movement. <br />
          Therefore, universities critically need to support this growth by
          providing AI-focused software engineering skills and specializations,
          to develop and sustain the next generation of AI-software
          infrastructure.
          <br />
          As part of supporting this cause, It is our pleasure to call for the
          initiation of the 2025 IEEE CIS Summer School on Computational
          Intelligence for Software Engineering. The main goal of the summer
          school is to provide senior undergraduate students, M.Sc. or PhD
          students and other potential audience with hands-on knowledge and
          expert views on the future development at the intersection between AI
          and software engineering. <br />
          Topics include how to design AI-enabled software systems, their
          evolution and debugging. The Talks will be given by Plenary Speakers
          that are active researchers in North American and international
          institutes. Lecturers will be given by local researchers from both
          Academia and Industry, to bring both perspectives for the students.
          The first edition of the summer school will be located in Tunisia,
          co-sponsored by the LARODEC Laboratory and the Institute of Data
          Engineering, Analytics, and Science at the University of
          Michigan-Flint.
